# FacialExpressions_neuralNetWork
The three-layer neural network is designed to classify emotions on human faces. It consists of an input layer that receives facial image data, a hidden layer that processes and extracts features, and an output layer that predicts the emotional state. Through training, it learns to identify and categorize emotions based on facial expressions.
